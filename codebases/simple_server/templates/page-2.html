            One solution to this problem is...
        </p>
        <h1>
            CONTAINERS!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Shipping containers are all built to the same size and specification - they can all be interacted with from outside identically no matter what's inside them
        </p>
        <p>
            In a similar way we can create a virtual <strong>container</strong> for our application to "live" in. The machine hosting our site doesn't need to interact with our app and its environment direclty, it only has to worry about handling the <strong>container</strong> surrounding it - much like a crane operator only has to know how to connect, life, move, and disconnect their crane to a shipping container

        <p>
            <strong>Docker</strong> is a platform that can build, run, and manage containers. When we want to host our app in the cloud we pick a host that supports docker, include a <strong>Dockerfile</strong> with instructions on how to build a container for our app (a bit like an .sql file builds and populates tables), and let the host handle it from there!
