            Up until now we've been working on and running our apps locally. When we've needed additional functionality we've imported and installed external tools and libraries onto our machine, or at least provided them to our apps within a virtual environment
        </p>
        <p>
            When we want to share our app with someone else we have to make sure they have the same versions of the same tools and libraries that we are using or the app won't run correctly
        </p>
        <p>
            We've been doing this by using the <strong>pipfile</strong> as a shopping list for dependencies which our friend can install to their virtual environment with <strong>pipenv install</strong> (after a lot of cursing and trying to figure out why it won't work)
        </p>
        <p>
          So what about when we want to host our app with a hosting service? How can we be sure the machine running the app will have the right dependencies installed?
